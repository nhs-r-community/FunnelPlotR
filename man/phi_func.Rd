\usage{
phi_func(n, zscores)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Single numeric value for the count of the number of groups
(and therefore z-scores)}

\item{zscores}{Vector of z-scores z-scores to be used.  Commonly, this would
be 'winsorised' first to remove impact of extreme outliers.  SHMI truncates
 instead, but this simply reduced the n as well as the z-score.}
}
\value{
A numeric phi value
}
