\arguments{
\item{numerator}{A vector of the numerator (observed events/counts) values.  Used as numerator of the Y-axis}

\item{denominator}{A vector of denominator (predicted/population etc.)  Used as denominator of the Y-axis and the scale of the x-axis}

\item{group}{A vector of group names as character or factor.  Used to aggregate and group points on plots}

\item{data_type}{A string identifying the type of data used for in the plot, the adjustment used and the reference point. One of: "SR" for indirectly standardised ratios, such SHMI, "PR" for proportions, or "RC" for ratios of counts. Default is "SR".}

\item{limit}{Plot limits, accepted values are: 95 or 99, corresponding to 95\% or 99.8\% quantiles of the distribution. Default=99,and applies to OD limits if both OD and Poisson are used.}

\item{label}{Whether to label outliers, highlighted groups, both or none. Default is "outlier", by accepted values are:\cr
\itemize{
\item{\code{"outlier"}}{ - Labels upper and lower outliers, determined in relation to the `limit` argument.}
\item{\code{"outlier_lower"}}{ - Labels just and lower outliers, determined in relation to the `limit` argument.}
\item{\code{"outlier_upper"}}{ - Labels just upper, determined in relation to the `limit` argument.}
\item{\code{"highlight"}}{ - Labels the value(s) given in the `highlight`argument.}
\item{\code{"both"}}{ - Labels both the highlighted values(s), upper and lower outliers, determined in relation to the `limit` argument.}
\item{\code{"both_lower"}}{ - Labels both the highlighted values(s) and lower outliers, determined in relation to the `limit` argument.}
\item{\code{"both_upper"}}{ - Labels both the highlighted values(s) and upper outliers, determined in relation to the `limit` argument.}
\item{\code{NA}}{ - No labels applied}
}}

\item{highlight}{Single or vector of points to highlight, with a different colour and point style. Should correspond to values specified to `group`. Default is NA, for no highlighting.}

\item{draw_unadjusted}{Draw control limits without overdispersion adjustment. (default=FALSE)}

\item{draw_adjusted}{Draw overdispersed limits using hierarchical model, assuming at group level, as described in Spiegelhalter (2012).
It calculates a second variance component ' for the 'between' standard deviation (\eqn{\tau}), that is added to the 'within' standard deviation (sigma) (default=TRUE)}

\item{sr_method}{Method for adjustment when using indirectly standardised ratios (type="SR") Either "CQC" or "SHMI" (default). There are a few methods for standardisation.  "CQC"/Spiegelhalter
uses a square-root transformation and Winsorises (rescales the outer most values to a particular percentile).
SHMI, instead, uses log-transformation and doesn't Winsorise, but truncates the distribution before assessing overdisperison .
Both methods then calculate a dispersion ratio (\eqn{\phi}) on this altered dataset.  This ratio is then used to scale the full dataset,
and the plot is drawn for the full dataset.}

\item{trim_by}{Proportion of the distribution for winsorisation/truncation. Default is 10 \% (0.1).  Note, this is applied in a two-sided
fashion, e.g. 10\% refers to 10\% at each end of the distribution (20\% winsorised/truncated)}

\item{title}{Plot title}

\item{multiplier}{Scale relative risk and funnel by this factor. Default to 1, but 100 sometime used, e.g. in some hospital mortality ratios.}

\item{x_label}{Title for the funnel plot x-axis.  Usually expected deaths, readmissions, incidents etc.}

\item{y_label}{Title for the funnel plot y-axis.  Usually a standardised ratio.}

\item{x_range}{Manually specify the y-axis min and max, in form c(min, max), e.g. c(0, 200). Default, "auto", allows function to estimate range.}

\item{y_range}{Manually specify the y-axis min and max, in form c(min, max), e.g. c(0.7, 1.3). Default, "auto", allows function to estimate range.}

\item{plot_cols}{A vector of 8 colours for funnel limits, in order: 95\% Poisson (lower/upper), 99.8\% Poisson (lower/upper), 95\% OD-adjusted (lower/upper), 99.8\% OD-adjusted (lower/upper).
Default has been chosen to avoid red and green which can lead to subconscious value judgements of good or bad.
Default is hex colours: c("#FF7F0EFF", "#FF7F0EFF", "#1F77B4FF","#1F77B4FF", "#9467BDFF", "#9467BDFF", "#2CA02CFF", "#2CA02CFF")}

\item{theme}{a ggplot theme function.  This can be a canned theme such as theme_bw(), a theme() with arguments, or your own custom theme function. Default is new funnel_clean(), but funnel_classic() is original format.}

\item{label_outliers}{Deprecated.  Please use the `label` argument instead.}

\item{Poisson_limits}{Deprecated.  Please use the `draw_unadjusted` argument instead.}

\item{OD_adjust}{Deprecated.  Please use the `draw_adjusted` argument instead.}

\item{xrange}{Deprecated.  Please use the `x_range` argument instead.}

\item{yrange}{Deprecated.  Please use the `y_range` argument instead.}
}
\value{
A fitted `funnelplot` object.  A `funnelplot` object is a list containing the following components:\cr
\item{print}{Prints the number of points, outliers and whether the plot has been adjusted, and prints the plot}
\item{plot}{A ggplot object with the funnel plot and the appropriate limits}
\item{limits_lookup}{A lookup table with selected limits for drawing a plot in software that requires limits.}
\item{aggregated_data}{A data.frame of the the aggregated dataset used for the plot.}
\item{outlier}{A data frame of outliers from the data.}
\item{tau2}{The between-groups standard deviation, \eqn{\tau^2}.}
\item{phi}{The dispersion ratio, \eqn{\phi}.}
\item{draw_adjusted}{Whether overdispersion-adjusted limits were used.}
\item{draw_unadjusted}{Whether unadjusted Poisson limits were used.}

\description{
An implementation of funnel plots for indirectly standardised ratios, as described by Spiegelhalter (2005) <https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.1970>.
There are several parameters for the input, with the assumption that you will want smooth,
overdispersed, funnel control limits.  Limits may be inflated for overdispersion based on the methods of DerSimonian & Laird (1986), buy calculating a between unit standard deviation (\eqn{\tau})
and constructing an additive random effects models, originally used for meta-analyses of clinical trials data.
}
\details{
Outliers are marked based on the grouping, and the limits chosen, corresponding to either 95\% or 99.8\% quantiles of the normal distribution.\cr
   Labels can attached using the `label` argument.\cr
   Overdispersion can be factored in based on the methods in Spiegelhalter et al. (2012), set `draw_adjusted` to FALSE to suppress this. \cr
   To use Poisson limits set `draw_unadjusted=TRUE`. \cr
   The plot colours deliberately avoid red-amber-green colouring, but you could extract this from the ggplot object and change manually if you like.
   Future versions of `funnelplotr` may allow users to change this.

# We will use the 'medpar' dataset from the 'COUNT' package.
