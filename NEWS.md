# FunnelPlotR 0.2.0

- This is the first CRAN release of FunnelPlotR, for building funnel plots of indirectly standardised ratios, such as
hospital mortality ratio.  It allows adjustment of funnel limits for overdispersion.  Future releases will extend 
functionality to proporitons and ratios of counts.
This package replaces the earlier CMFunnels package, that was only release on GitHub.
